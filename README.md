## Perfume Market Analysis
### I made a dashboard using Power BI to analyse the e-commerce market of fragrances in 2024

One of my passions is perfumery, so I decided to dive into a database with perfume listings sourced from eBay to analise it and take valuables insights from it

1. Downloaded a csv database from Kaggle with usability 10.00
2. Imported the files to Power BI
3. Assessed which informations were relevants to the analysis
4. I made and ETL process to fix wrong data, like columns with missing brand, typos, etc
